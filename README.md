# Social-Network-Analysis

In this project we analyzed the marvel's network with fun and insightful tools with Python. 
Use of Gephi, computation of betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, average path length, etc.

Very visual and playful project to see the different clusters in the network (X-men, Avengers, Spiderman, etc.).
